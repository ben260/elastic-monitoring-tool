  This lightweight, self-hosted utility built with Next.js helps you quickly spot and manage unresponsive Elasticsearch Agents and Data Streams, so you don‚Äôt miss important issues. It uses Elastic Watches, prioritising alerts into Low, Medium, and High levels to help prevent alert fatigue. The interactive tables make managing alerts simple, and the tool automatically creates ready-to-use Watcher API requests to speed up updates in Kibana‚Äôs Dev Tools Console. This way, setting up and maintaining monitoring at scale is more efficient and less error-prone.

## Features

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Monitors Elasticsearch Data Streams and Agents using Elastic Watches.</strong><br>
    <em>Stay informed about the health of your data sources to avoid unexpected data loss.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Categorises watches into three priority levels: High, Medium, Low</strong><br>
    <em>Helps you focus on the most critical issues first and reduces alert fatigue by organising alerts by severity.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Provides an intuitive, interactive web UI</strong><br>
    <em>Makes it easy to view, edit, and manage alert setups without needing to keep track of the watches manually.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automatically generates updated Elasticsearch Watcher API requests when priorities are changed</strong><br>
    <em>Saves time and eliminates errors by providing ready-to-use API requests for quick updates via Kibana‚Äôs Dev Tools Console.</em>
  </li>
  
</ul>

## How to Use

1. Create High, Medium, and Low priority Watches for both Agents and Datastreams.
2. Make updates in the tables on the Agents and Datastreams pages then use the generated API requests to update Watches in the **Kibana's Dev Tools Console**
3. View watcher status and details using the Watches page.

![Demo](/datastreamspage.png 'Demo')

<br>
<p align="center">Lightweight, self-hosted utility built with Next.js that helps you monitor unresponsive Elasticsearch Agents and Data Streams by setting up and managing Elastic Watches. It prioritizes alerts into Low, Medium, and High categories and provides interactive tables for viewing and managing your alert setups. The tool automatically generates ready-to-use Watcher API requests for easy alert updates via Kibana‚Äôs Dev Tools Console, making it simpler and faster to set up reliable monitoring for data sources at scale.</p>



## Features

- Monitors Elasticsearch Data Streams and Agents using Elastic [Watches](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/alerts-cases/watcher/how-watcher-works).
- Categorises watches into three priority levels:
  - High
  - Medium
  - Low
- Automatically generates updated **Elasticsearch Watcher API requests** when
  priorities are updated which are ready to use in **Kibana's Dev Tools Console**

## How to Use

1. Create High, Medium, and Low priority Watches for both Agents and Datastreams.
2. Make updates in the tables on the Agents and Datastreams pages then use the generated API requests to update Watches in the **Kibana's Dev Tools Console**
3. View watcher status and details using the Watches page.
